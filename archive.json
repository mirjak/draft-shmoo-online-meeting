I was planning to update the draft and add a proposal anyway (just this week id super full as there is a holiday tomorrow); so a PR would be more than welcome!\r\n\r\nHere is as a reference what I originally proposed to the list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo I think it might actually be worth to think about picking three time slots with 8h offset and rotated between those rather than orienting too much towards the local time. Participants are not equally distributed over all time zone; and I don\u2019t mean that some zones have more people than other but that there are time zones in the world where there is no land and as such no-one lives. And so not all starting times work equally well. This is more or less one of the reason why we didn\u2019t start a fixed local time for the last couple of meetings but shifted one hour in one or the other direction (to basically decrease the overall pain at least a bit).\r\n\r\nI would propose the following slots (with the limitation that the first slot always has to be in summer to work a bit better for both China and Australian/New Zealand). I propose the slots because I think they are probably as good as possible for most of the participants. However, they are more or less also reflecting the start at 13:00 in either Europe, China, or west coast US time we used so far. Or you can also see them to start at 5:00 or 6:00 in either Europe, China, or West Coast USA.\r\n\r\nBerlin (Germany)\t14:00:00\tCEST\tUTC+2 hours\r\nBeijing (China)\t\t20:00:00\tCST\tUTC+8 hours\r\nSydney (Australia)\t22:00:00\tAEST\tUTC+10 hours\r\nWellington (New Zealand)00:00:00\tNZST\tUTC+12 hours\r\nNew York (USA\t\t08:00:00\tEDT\tUTC-4 hours\r\nSan Francisco (USA)\t05:00:00\tPDT\tUTC-7 hours\r\nUTC (GMT)\t\t12:00:00\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBerlin (Germany)\t22:00:00\tCET\tUTC+1 hour\r\nBeijing (China)\t\t05:00:00\tCST\tUTC+8 hours\r\nSydney (Australia)\t08:00:00\tAEDT\tUTC+11 hours\r\nWellington (New Zealand)10:00:00\tNZDT\tUTC+13 hours\r\nNew York (USA)\t\t16:00:00\tEST\tUTC-5 hours\r\nSan Francisco (USA)\t13:00:00\tPST\tUTC-8 hours\r\nUTC (GMT)\t\t21:00:00\t\t\r\n\r\nBerlin (Germany)\t06:00:00\tCET\tUTC+1 hour\r\nBeijing (China)\t\t13:00:00\tCST\tUTC+8 hours\r\nSydney (Australia)\t16:00:00\tAEDT\tUTC+11 hours\r\nWellington (New Zealand)18:00:00\tNZDT\tUTC+13 hours\r\nNew York (USA)\t\t00:00:00\tEST\tUTC-5 hours\r\nSan Francisco (USA)\t21:00:00\tPST\tUTC-8 hours\r\nUTC (GMT)\t\t05:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nI came up with these slots by starring at this page for a while:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=8&month=12&year=2021&p1=204&p2=33&p3=240&p4=264&p5=179&p6=224&iv=0\r\n\r\nBut note that the picture looks slightly different if you select a date that is in EU/US winter time and AUS/NZ summer time.",

I believe that 0700/1500/2200 might be better.\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n- The Asia/Europe/NA fits more into the conventional notion of the workday (~0800-1800) -- which matters when we use criteria that explicitly considers the fairness to these regions, as this draft does\r\n- In the attached screenshots, there are fewer bold slots (where part of the sessions fall into the 12am-6am period). India gets one more bold meeting, but China and the US West Coast get one less, which frankly seems like a good trade in both raw population and actual IETF participant terms. \r\n\r\nThere's a decent case for moving 2200 to 2300 -- slighly better for Asia while pushing Eastern Time an hour past midnight in the summer. That worsens the bold stats a bit, but also makes the slots exactly 8 hours apart.\r\n\r\n![northern summer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398865/118535506-67d72200-b6ff-11eb-9615-47c2ff17ef17.png)\r\n![southern summer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398865/118535523-6a397c00-b6ff-11eb-8544-49db0f4b8613.png)\r\n\r\n",

First, I'm not a morning person but if really needed I would find starting at 5am still acceptable. Second and more important, it really is a difference if only e.g. 1h is overlapping with this slot or the whole meeting. For me the starting times at 12am, 1am, 2am, 3am, or 4am should really be minimised and that's less often the case in the 5/12/21 case.",
